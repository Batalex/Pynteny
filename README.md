# Pynteny: synteny hmm searches made easy in Python

1. Install environment

conda env create -f environment.yml

# Possible applications:

1. Detect operons in (assembled) environmental samples, MAGs for instance. These operons may be specific of certain taxa, which could lead to taxonomic identification/confirmation besides functional identification.


# TODO: 
1. Use Path from pathlib instead of str
2. Enable search of TigrFAM by gene name? need gene/TigrFAM dictionary
3. Enable inputing gbk files instead of fasta/assembly files
