            in the negative (antisense) strand. Searches can be made strand-insensitive by omitting the $>$ or $<$ symbol. 
            Several HMMs can be assigned to the same ORF, in which case the search is performed for all of them.
            In this case, HMM names must be separated by "|" and grouped within parentheses, as shown above.
